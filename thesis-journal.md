# FINISHING THESIS IN 30 DAYS

My bachelor thesis is due in 30 days. As it is not much time to finish it, I figured
making a journal about it might help me boost my productivity.

## Thesis topic
In short, my job is to design a website that showcases different types of services our
government provides and info about them. It should serve as an e-shop where citizens can
save services they are interested in and track their progress. I have to design, develop
and test the website and write a thesis about it.

The website is written in plain HTML, CSS, and JS. Backend is written in Python. And the
thesis is being written in LaTeX.

## DAY 1
Writing all that progress down made me realize there is much more work to be done than I
expected. Even though it is not obvious from the progress tracker, implementation is 75%
done because a website design is a major part of the work. The thesis on the other hand
is barely started.

The goal for today is to start implementing the communication form generation. There is
insufficient data the government provides for this. So a part of my work is to add some
fake data and then suggest improvements for the dataset. 

I haven't opened the implementation for a few weeks. I fired the website up and found
out no data are being displayed. After a few minutes of debugging I found out the
endpoint I use to receive data from is not working correctly. I sent a few emails so
hopefully, it will get fixed as soon as possible.

The goal is therefore changed and I will work on improving the thesis introduction to
open data.
